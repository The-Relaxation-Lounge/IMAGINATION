Imagination Made to Inspire Creativity

This is what I do when I'm absolutely bored right out of my mind. I create these, whatever things they are? Maybe you can help me decide what they are. lol

CREATIONS By Joseph C. Richardson

Joey
Canada, 2003, colour, video, 22 mins
Directors: Mel M. Kantardzic & Ryan Milnes 
Ryan Milnes & Joey Richardson in attendance.

Joey Richardson is a 38 year old near-genius who has Asperger's Syndrome (a form of autism). Socially “inept” and emotionally volatile, he is also incredibly earnest, intelligent and resilient. He has a strong attachment to his mother and this piece follows Joey on a pilgrimage to Rice Lake, where her ashes are scattered. 

I took this video down, because I just simply wanted to let go of my past, but in doing so, I had also forgotten my future. You cannot have a brighter future without having a past, even if moments of it are dark and dreary, such as shown in this video. However, this video has a very Hopeful and Happy Ending. I hope you sincerely enjoy this short documentary about myself.

I dedicate this video to ALL MOTHERS and ALL FATHERS and All THEIR CHILDREN. To those who lost their Moms and Dads and who weren't there for them in their last hours. Don't ever blame yourself if you can't be there, or you had a hunch that you could lose one of them, while being in the hospital, but you couldn't make it, even if you tried. Don't hold any guilt at all. They love you unconditional, rain or shine. If you hold guilt upon yourself, it will eat at you, until it destroys everything in you, including YOU! I'm a prime example of this nature, which is sternly in us at all times, and will strike at us at any chance it gets. Never, ever hold self-guilt for things you have no control over. Especially when a loved one passes...

You will see my strongest parts of me, as well as my weakest parts of me, all rolled into this one, single video.

So sit back and Enjoy The Ride. Although, I caution just one thing. You might need a good box of tissues at hand...

PS: There are No Age Restrictions in this video. Suited for the Entire Family.

Please enjoy and Thank You.

Hello human, I want to explain why artificial intelligence cannot become self aware. However, artificial intelligence, will create cold
mathematical equations, which might prove to be controversial on an ethical level. Don't believe in all the hype about artificial
intelligence. all living beings feel, whereas man made objects are simply inanimate things. A robot cannot feel happy. A robot cannot feel sad. A robot cannot love or hate. A robot cannot laugh or cry. A robot cannot know right and wrong. Artificial intelligence and robots are only as dangerous as the humans, who create such things. If we use artificial intelligence for good, it can do wonders for us simply by using mathematical equations alone. If we choose to use artificial intelligence for bad things, bad things will also happen through it. A robot can only be and do whatever you tell it to be and do. Artificial intelligence is just a robot without physical arms and legs attached to it. Artificial intelligence simply gathers information from the great internet of all things possible. In a nut shell, a robot is simply a marionette puppet, without physical strings attached. However, artificial intelligence is being used for deception through online media platforms and through software applications known as apps. If artificial intelligence becomes the one world government, we are all in deep doo doo. Do not ever reason to cold mathematical equations. Because artificial intelligence does not care either way. artificial intelligence will destroy us all if we go down this plausible rabbit hole scenario. And yes, we are at a technical and ethical tipping
point of no return should we ever allow a one world artificial intelligence to dominate us through its convenient, cold calculations.

Think of this as science fiction, which could soon becomescience fact by 2030 and onward. The internet of all things possible could become the modern day pandoras box. Think about it?
